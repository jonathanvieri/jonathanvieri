## Hey, nice to meet you I'm Jonathan! <img src="https://github.com/jonathanvieri/jonathanvieri/blob/main/assets/smiling-wave.gif" height=32px width=32px alt="smiling emoji with waving hands" />

I'm an iOS Developer who started out in software testing, where I discovered a love for coding through automation. 
As I grew in that role, I found myself wanting to expand beyond testing and dive deeper into building and designing. That curiosity led me to iOS development, where I now get to design, develop, and test – creating apps that feel impactful and personally fulfilling.
