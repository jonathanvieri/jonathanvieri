## Hey there, I'm Jonathan, nice to meet you!  <img src="https://github.com/jonathanvieri/jonathanvieri/blob/main/assets/smiling-wave.gif" height=32px width=32px alt="smiling emoji with waving hands" />

I'm an iOS Developer who started out in software testing, where I discovered a love for coding through automation. 
As I grew in that role, I found myself wanting to expand beyond testing and dive deeper into building and designing. That curiosity led me to iOS development, where I now get to design, develop, and test â€“ creating apps that feel impactful and personally fulfilling.

### ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Working On
- **Split Bill App**: A helper app for splitting bills, using OCR capabilities from the Vision framework (Targeting for App store release).

### ðŸš€ Projects
- **Pack Buddy**: A travel app for creating and organizing packing checklists.
- **Horizon**: A weather app with daily notifications, location-based forecasts, and AQI data.
- **Sentry**: A simple mock CCTV app for detecting objects using live camera and play video from URL or library.
